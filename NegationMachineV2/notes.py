Figure 4 top right demonstrates that the more frequent a word is, the happier, stronger and calmer it tends to be. 
The observed linear relationship between log frequency of occurrence and valence is reasonably strong: the Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient is 0.18, and the increase in valence between the least and most frequent words is on the order of 2 points on the 9-point scale. This corroborates the finding of Garcia, Garas and Schweitzer (2012) and runs counter to the claim of Kloumann et al. (2012) that the positivity bias in English words is only observed in word types (there are more positive than negative words) and that correlations between frequency and valence, if any, are corpus-specific and small. The discrepancy may be due to the much broader range of frequency that we consider here, with fourteen thousand words from the top of the frequency list rather than five thousand words in each of the corpora considered in Kloumann et al. (2012). We leave the verification of the positivity bias over a broader frequency range to further research.
